# SprinklrClient
A simple Python client for interacting with Sprinklr's REST API

**Notes:**
- After registering for a developer account at [Developer.Sprinklr.com](https://developer.sprinklr.com), creating an app and authorizing it to a Sprinklr account as outlined in the [Getting Started](https://developer.sprinklr.com/docs/read/api_overview/Getting_Started) tutorial, the GetAccessToken command of SprinklrClientTest.py can be used to retrieve and store the AccessToken, RefreshToken and key to a .conf file for use by the other API examples. Make sure the Sprinklr.conf file is kept safe!

- The Report examples will not work as is - they will need customizing to unique customer environments. Follow the example in the [Sprinklr Reporting Widget Tutorial](https://developer.sprinklr.com/docs/read/api_tutorials/Sprinklr_Reporting_Widget_Tutorial), translating values as necessary.

Please let me know if you are using this library and send feedback to SteveDz@Sprinklr.com - Thanks!
